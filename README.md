  ## Description:
  This is a work team profile generator that uses Node.js through the command line. This profile generator has three work profile categories - Manager, Engineer, and Intern. There is only one Manager for the work team profile and an unlimited amount of Engineers and Interns that can be added. To start the application, the user will need to be in the root directory folder and then will type "node index" into the command line to begin creating their work team profile. You will first be prompted with the Manager's info and then asked if you would like to add an Engineer, Intern, or finish the profile. Once the user has completed the profile to their needs, an "index.html" file will be created in the "dist" folder. The user can then use this file to view their team's profile so they can have easy access to their emails, id numbers and more!
