# Team Profile Generator

## Description:
This is a work team profile generator that uses Node.js through the command line. This profile generator has three work profile categories - Manager, Engineer, and Intern. There is only one Manager for the work team profile and an unlimited amount of Engineers and Interns can be added. To start the application, be in the root directory and type "node index" into the command line to begin creating your work team profile. You will first be prompted with the Manager's info and then asked if you would like to add an Engineer, Intern, or finish the profile. Once the user has completed the profile to their needs, a "index.html" file will be created in the "dist" folder. The user can then user this file to view their team's profile so they can have easy access to their emails, id numbers and more!
